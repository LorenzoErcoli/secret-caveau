# Secret Caveau

This repository contains a simple web page that simulates unlocking a vault by entering three passwords. Each password field must match a specific word for the caveau (vault) to open.

Open `index.html` in a browser to try it out. The page uses `styles.css` for basic styling and `script.js` for the password check logic.
