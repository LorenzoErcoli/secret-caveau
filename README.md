# Secret Caveau

This repository contains a simple web page that simulates unlocking a vault by entering three passwords. Each password field must match a specific word for the caveau (vault) to open.

Open `index.html` in a browser to try it out. The page uses `styles.css` for a small cyberpunk look and `script.js` for the password check logic. When the passwords "Giornata", "Radio" and "Hollywood" are entered correctly the inputs disappear and an animated "Caveau aperto" message is shown.
