# Secret Caveau

This repository contains a simple web page that simulates escaping from a locked vault. The players are trapped inside and must enter three specific passwords to open the door.

Open `index.html` in a browser to try it out. The page uses `styles.css` for an enlarged cyberpunk interface and `script.js` for the password check logic. When the passwords "Giornata", "Radio" and "Hollywood" are entered correctly the inputs disappear and an animated "Caveau aperto" message is shown.
